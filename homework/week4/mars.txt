1. What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)?
	* .data indicates that following data items are stored in the data segment
	* .word       Store the listed value(s) as 32 bit words on word boundary
	* .text indicates that following items are stored in the user text segment, typically instructions
	
2. How do you set a breakpoint in MARS? Set a breakpoint on line 14 and run to it. What is the instruction address? Has line 14 executed yet?
	* 0x00400020, not yet
		
3. Once at a breakpoint, how do you continue to execute your code? How do you step through your code? Run the code to completion.
	* press go (F5), press step (F7)
	
4. Find the "Run I/O" window. What number did the program output? Which fib number is this?
	* 34, 9th fib number
	
5. At what address is n stored in memory? Try finding this by (1) looking at the Data Segment and (2) looking at the machine code (Code column in the Text Segment).
	* 0x10010010
	
6. Without using the "Edit" tab, have the program calculate the 13th fib number by manually modifying this memory location before execution. You may find it helpful to uncheck the "Hexadecimal Values" box at the bottom of the Data Segment.
	* 13th fib number is 233
	
7. How do you view and modify the contents of a register? Reset the simulation (Run-->Reset or F12) and now calculate the 13th fib number by (1) breaking at a well-chosen spot, (2) modifying a single register, and then (3) unsetting the breakpoint.
	* put a breakpoint on 0x00400014 and modify the content of t$3
	
8. Lines 19 and 21 use the syscall instruction. What is it and how do you use it? (Hint: look in Help)
	* The program communicates with the operating system via syscalls. 1 means print integer, 10 means program termination.
