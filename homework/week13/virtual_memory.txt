Exercise 1: A Sample Run (CAMERA)
	Randomly generated memory access sequence: B1, 2C, 41, 11, 5D, 9B, B6, FB, 22, A6
	2 TLB hits; 8 TLB misses
	0 page hits; 8 page faults
	0 page hits because the number physical frames and TLB entries are equal, so whenever there is a TLB miss a page fault also occurs
	
Exercise 2: MISS! (CAMERA)	
	Memory access sequence: 20, 40, 60, 80, A0, C0, E0, 20, 40, 60
	Since page size is 128 bytes (5 bit offset), the last 5 bits have to be always zero. So we are making 32 long jumps
	
Exercise 3: Memory Systems Engineering (CAMERA)
	Problem is that the TLB size is the same as the number of physical frames. So either we should add more memory or decrease the TLB size
	
Exercise 4: Putting it all in Context (VMSIM)
	P1, P2, P3 and P4 are processor cores in a multi-processor environment	
	CAMERA only used 1 processor so the content of the TLB never has to be flushed
	In VMSIM the TLB has to be invalidated every time we switch between processors, so the TLB hit rate is much smaller
