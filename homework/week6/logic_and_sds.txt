1.
not, and, or, xor, nand, nor, xnor

2.
    a) !A!B + !AB + A!B
    b) !AB + A!B
    c) !A!B + AB

3. use 2 NAND gates and split the wire after the first one

4. A truth table with n inputs has 2^n rows. Each logic gate has a 0 or a 1 at each of these
rows. Imagining a function as a 2^n-bit number, we count 2^2^n
total functions, or 16 in the case of n = 2.

5.

    a) AC
    b) A + !C
    c) !A + B!C + !BC
