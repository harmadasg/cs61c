# Berkeley's CS 61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures)

As the second step in my journey to complete the recommended courses on [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) I worked through the topic of Computer Architecture with the following:
* The book Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
* The [video lectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL-XXv-cvA_iCl2-D-FS5mk0jFF6cYSJs_) from the Spring 2015 Berkeley course

The required materials are mostly available [online](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61c/sp15/), with some exceptions for project 3. After digging for the missing items I was able to collect all of them, see the relevant notes among the project files.
